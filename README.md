 Oil Spill Detection Using SAR Satellite Imagery
 
   An End-to-End Deep Learning System for Environmental Monitoring


             --📌 Abstract--

Oil spills are among the most severe environmental disasters, causing long-term damage to marine ecosystems, coastal regions, and human livelihoods. Traditional monitoring methods are time-consuming and limited in coverage.

This project presents an AI-driven Oil Spill Detection and Severity Assessment System using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery and a U-Net deep learning architecture. The system performs pixel-level segmentation to accurately identify oil spill regions, assesses spill severity, and provides an interactive web-based user interface for real-time analysis.

            ---1️⃣ Introduction---

Marine oil spills are difficult to monitor due to their dynamic nature and large spatial extent. Satellite imagery provides a scalable solution, and SAR images are especially effective as they operate independently of weather and lighting conditions.

This project builds a complete AI pipeline, from raw satellite data to a deployed web application, enabling users to upload SAR images and instantly receive oil spill detection results


          ---2️⃣ Problem Statement---

The goal of this project is to:

--->Detect oil spills from SAR satellite images

--->Segment oil and non-oil regions at pixel level

--->Quantify the severity of the spill

--->Provide an easy-to-use interface for non-technical users

--->Deploy the solution as a publicly accessible application



         ---3️⃣ Why SAR Images?---

Unlike optical images, SAR images:

-->Work day and night

-->Penetrate clouds and fog

-->Highlight oil spills as bright (white) regions

-->Are widely used in real-world maritime surveillance

Important:

In this project:

-->White pixels → Oil Spill

-->Black pixels → Water


           ---4️⃣ Dataset Description---

Image Type: Grayscale SAR images

Labels: Binary segmentation masks

Mask Encoding:

White (1) → Oil

Black (0) → Water




           ---5️⃣ Project Workflow---



<img width="416" height="727" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1069f199-994f-49c0-a8d5-60240233b6a4" />



                 ---6️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)---


EDA was performed to understand:

Pixel intensity distribution

Image dimensions

Mask uniqueness

Oil vs water pixel ratio


Key observations:

SAR images are single-channel (grayscale)

Oil regions appear brighter

Class imbalance exists (water dominates)

                       ---7️⃣ Data Preprocessing---


Steps applied:

Grayscale normalization (0–1)

Resizing to 256×256

Binary thresholding for masks


Optional data augmentation:

Horizontal flip

Vertical flip

Rotation



                      ---8️⃣ Model Architecture – U-Net---

The U-Net architecture is chosen due to its effectiveness in segmentation tasks.

Architecture Highlights:

-->Encoder (contracting path) extracts contextual features

-->Decoder (expanding path) restores spatial resolution

-->Skip connections preserve fine-grained details

-->Final sigmoid layer outputs pixel-wise probabilities

Severity is calculated based on oil pixel percentage:

       Oil  Coverage	                        Severity	                               Risk
            0%	                                 None	                             threat
          < 5%	                                 Low	                             Minimal impact
          5–20%	                              Medium	                           Moderate risk
          > 20%	                               High	                              Severe threat
